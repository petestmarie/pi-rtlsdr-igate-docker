Dockerfile and systemd script for running an APRS IGate (via [Direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf)) on a Raspberry Pi with an attached RTL-SDR dongle.

I've tested this on a Raspberry Pi 4.

## Usage

Make sure you have Docker installed on the Raspberry Pi. You probably want to run

    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh

After that, you can easily run the version I have in Docker Hub (no need to even clone this repo). Replace `YOURCALLHERE` with your HAM callsign and `YOURPASSWORDHERE` with your APRS password (generate one [here](http://apps.magicbug.co.uk/passcode/)) in the below command.

    docker pull erdemirmesut/pi-rtlsdr-igate
    docker run --privileged -e MYCALL=YOURCALLHERE -e APRS_PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORDHERE -it

You now have a functioning IGate on your Raspberry Pi! If you also want to send a beacon with the position of your IGate you can pass a latitude and longitude via environment variables.

    docker run --privileged -e MYCALL=YOURCALLHERE -e APRS_PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORDHERE -e LATITUDE=30.1234 -e LONGITUDE=-90.1234 -e COMMENT="Raspberry Pi + RTL-SDR + Direwolf + Docker" -it erdemirmesut/pi-rtlsdr-igate

OR you can use a connected NMEA GPS to send position packets by setting the NMEA_GPS environment variable

    docker run --privileged -e MYCALL=YOURCALLHERE -e APRS_PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORDHERE -e NMEA_GPS=/dev/ttyACM0 -e COMMENT="Raspberry Pi + RTL-SDR + Direwolf + Docker" -it erdemirmesut/pi-rtlsdr-igate

OR you can use a running gpsd instance by setting the GPSD_HOST (and optional GPSD_PORT) environment variables. You can use `dockerhost` to point back to the host machine. Note that you must use `--net=host` to access gpsd at `localhost`.

    docker run --privileged -e MYCALL=YOURCALLHERE -e APRS_PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORDHERE -e GPSD_HOST=localhost --net=host -e COMMENT="Raspberry Pi + RTL-SDR + Direwolf + Docker" -it erdemirmesut/pi-rtlsdr-igate

## systemd script

I've also included a systemd script which makes it easy to have the Raspberry Pi start the IGate. To use it copy the systemd file to the appropriate location.

    sudo cp docker-igate.service.example /etc/systemd/system/docker-igate.service

Then edit the file to reflect your callsign, APRS password and (optionally) location.

    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/docker-igate.service

Now start the service for the first time

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl start docker-igate

Make sure it's running with `docker ps` and `systemctl status`

    docker ps
    sudo systemctl status docker-igate

Then optionally tell systemd to start the service at boot

    sudo systemctl enable docker-igate

You can see logs from the container by running

    docker logs -f docker-igate

## Push a new version to Docker Hub

This is mostly for my own reference. But you might want to run a variation of this command if you fork the Dockerfile and want to push it to Docker Hub (replace the docker hub repo with your repo).

    docker build . --tag "petestmarie/pi-rtlsdr-igate:latest"
    docker push petestmarie/pi-rtlsdr-igate:latest

## TODO

* Configure logging in a smarter way, probably in the systemd script (right now all logs from the Docker container go to `/var/log/syslog`)
